# Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript

After a long time learning and working with object-oriented programming, I took a step back to think about system complexity.
“Complexity is anything that makes software hard to understand or to modify." — John Outerhout

Doing some research, I found functional programming concepts like immutability and pure function. Those concepts are big advantages to build side-effect-free functions,
so it is easier to maintain systems — with some other benefits.

In this post, I will tell you more about functional programming, and some important concepts, with a lot of code examples. In Javascript!

What is functional programming?
Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs 
— that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia

# Refactoring JavaScript for Performance and Readability

Recently, I wrote an article about how to write very fast JavaScript. 
Some of the examples took it to the extreme and became very quick at the cost of being totally unmaintainable.
There's a middle ground between speed and comprehension and that's where good code lives.

We're going to refactor some pieces of code based off real examples that I've come across. 
Sometimes I'll need to perform this kind of refactoring on my own code before submitting a PR.
Other times I'll do a small refactor of existing code at the start of a story or bug to make my changes easier to implement.
