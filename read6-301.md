# An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com
### What Is Node.js?
Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi.
It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

### “Hello, World!” the Node.js Way

You can check that Node is installed on your system by opening a terminal and typing node -v. If all has gone well, you should see something like v12.14.1 displayed. 
This is the current LTS version at the time of writing.

Next, create a new file hello.js and copy in the following code:

console.log("Hello, World!");
This uses Node’s built-in console module to display a message in a terminal window. To run the example, enter the following command:

node hello.js
If Node.js is configured properly, “Hello, World!” will be displayed.

**Node.js Has Excellent Support for Modern JavaScript**

### Introducing npm, the JavaScript Package Manager
s I mentioned earlier, Node comes bundled with a package manager called npm. To check which version you have installed on your system, type npm -v.

### What Is Node.js Used For?
Node.js Lets Us Run JavaScript on the Server.

“Hello, World!” — Server Version
Let’s have a quick look at a “Hello, World!” example HTTP server:

`const http = require('http');

http.createServer((request, response) => {
  response.writeHead(200);
  response.end('Hello, World!');
}).listen(3000);`

console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');

To run this, copy the code into a file named hello-world-server.js and run it using node hello-world-server.js.

Open up a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see “Hello, World!” displayed in the browser.
