## Intro + Scripts
* A script is a series of instructions that the computer
can follow in order to achieve a goal.
* Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
all the instructions.
* Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically.
* To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
## Expressions + Operators
* An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value.
there are two types of expressions. 
 1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE.
  var color = 'beige'; 
2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE.
var area = 3 * 2;
* Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values. Such as:
1. ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS 
Assign a value to a variable 
color = 'beige'; 
2. ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
Perform basic math 
area = 3 * 2;
3. STRING OPERATORS
Combine two strings
greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Mol ly';
4. COMPARISON OPERATORS 
Compare two values and return true or false
buy = 3 > 5; 
5. LOGICAL OPERATORS
Combine expressions and return true or fa 1 se
buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);
