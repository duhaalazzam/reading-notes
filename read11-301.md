# <%= EJS %>

Embedded JavaScript templating.

# What is EJS?

What is the "E" for? "Embedded?" Could be. How about "Effective," "Elegant," or just "Easy"? 
EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. 
No religiousness about how to organize things. No reinvention of iteration and control-flow. It's just plain JavaScript.

**Get Started**
**Install**
It's easy to install EJS with NPM.

`$ npm install ejs`
Use
Pass EJS a template string and some data. BOOM, you've got some HTML.

`let ejs = require('ejs');
let people = ['geddy', 'neil', 'alex'];
let html = ejs.render('<%= people.join(", "); %>', {people: people});`

CLI
Feed it a template file and a data file, and specify an output file.

`ejs ./template_file.ejs -f data_file.json -o ./output.html`

Browser support
Download a browser build from the latest release, and use it in a script tag.

`<script src="ejs.js"></script>
<script>
  let people = ['geddy', 'neil', 'alex'];
  let html = ejs.render('<%= people.join(", "); %>', {people: people});
</script>`

Docs
Example

`<% if (user) { %>
  <h2><%= user.name %></h2>
<% } %>`

Usage

`let template = ejs.compile(str, options);
template(data);
// => Rendered HTML string

ejs.render(str, data, options);
// => Rendered HTML string

ejs.renderFile(filename, data, options, function(err, str){
    // str => Rendered HTML string
});`

Includes
Includes are relative to the template with the include call. 
(This requires the 'filename' option.) For example if you have "./views/users.ejs" and "./views/user/show.ejs" you would use <%- include('user/show'); %>.

You'll likely want to use the raw output tag (<%-) with your include to avoid double-escaping the HTML output.

`<ul>
  <% users.forEach(function(user){ %>
    <%- include('user/show', {user: user}); %>
  <% }); %>
</ul>`

# How To Use EJS to Template Your Node Application

**Introduction**

When creating quick on-the-fly Node applications, an easy and fast way to template our application is sometimes necessary.

Jade comes as the view engine for Express by default but Jade syntax can be overly complex for many use cases.
EJS is one alternative does that job well and is very easy to set up. 
Let’s take a look at how we can create a simple application and use EJS to include repeatable parts of our site (partials) and pass data to our views.

**Node Setup**
Let’s go into our package.json file and set up our project there.

`package.json
{
  "name": "node-ejs",
  "main": "server.js",
  "dependencies": {
    "ejs": "^3.1.5",
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  }
}`
 
All we will need is Express and EJS. Now we have to install the dependencies we just defined. Go ahead and run:

`npm install`
 
With all of our dependencies installed, 
let’s configure our application to use EJS and set up our routes for the two pages we need: the index page (full width) and the about page (sidebar).
We will do all of this inside our server.js file.

server.js
`// load the things we need
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

// set the view engine to ejs
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

// use res.render to load up an ejs view file

// index page
app.get('/', function(req, res) {
    res.render('pages/index');
});

// about page
app.get('/about', function(req, res) {
    res.render('pages/about');
});

app.listen(8080);
console.log('8080 is the magic port');`
 
Here we define our application and set it to show on port 8080.
We also have to set EJS as the view engine for our Express application using app.set('view engine', 'ejs');. 
Notice how we send a view to the user by using res.render(). It is important to note that res.render() will look in a views folder for the view.
So we only have to define pages/index since the full path is views/pages/index.

**Start Up our Server**
Go ahead and start the server using:

`node server.js`
 
Now we can see our application in the browser at http://localhost:8080 and http://localhost:8080/about. 
Our application is set up and we have to define our view files and see how EJS works there.
