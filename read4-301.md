### Regex
Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are extremely useful in extracting information from any text by searching for one or more matches of a specific search pattern.
you can actually use this tool in (almost) all programming languages.

**Basic topics**

`
Anchors — ^ and $
^The        matches any string that starts with The -> Try it!
end$        matches a string that ends with end
^The end$   exact string match (starts and ends with The end)
roar        matches any string that has the text roar in it

Quantifiers — * + ? and {}
abc*        matches a string that has ab followed by zero or more c -> Try it!
abc+        matches a string that has ab followed by one or more c
abc?        matches a string that has ab followed by zero or one c
abc{2}      matches a string that has ab followed by 2 c
abc{2,}     matches a string that has ab followed by 2 or more c
abc{2,5}    matches a string that has ab followed by 2 up to 5 c
a(bc)*      matches a string that has a followed by zero or more copies of the sequence bc
a(bc){2,5}  matches a string that has a followed by 2 up to 5 copies of the sequence bc

OR operator — | or []
a(b|c)     matches a string that has a followed by b or c (and captures b or c) -> Try it!
a[bc]      same as previous, but without capturing b or c

### CSS Grid Layout

CSS Grid Layout (aka “Grid”), is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that aims to do nothing less than completely change the way we design grid-based user interfaces.

**Important terminology**

Grid Container:The element on which display: grid is applied. It’s the direct parent of all the grid items. 
Grid Item:The children (i.e. direct descendants) of the grid container.

**Grid properties**

Properties for the Parent (Grid Container):
1.display
2.grid-template-columns
grid-template-rows

**Properties for the Children (Grid Items)**

1.grid-column-start
grid-column-end
grid-row-start
grid-row-end
2.grid-column
grid-row

### Responsive design with CSS Grid

CSS grid lets us not only arrange elements in a row or a column, but in multiple rows and columns. Finally two dimensional layouts are becoming simpler!

`grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr));
object-fit: cover;
