# Operators and Loops
### Comparsion Operators
* Comparsion Operators used to compare one value to another,and the result will be:true or false.,exampls:
  1. is equal to ==
  2. is not equal to !=
  3. strict equal to ===
  4. strict not equal to !==
  5. greater than >
  6. less than <
  7. greater than or equal to >=
  8. less than or equal to <=
  
  ### Logical Operators
  * logical operators allow you to compare the result of more than comparsion operator.examples
   1. logical and &&,returns true if all conditions is true.
   2. logical or||,returns true if one of the conditions is true.
   3. logical not !,it reverse the sate of condition.
   
  ### Loops
  * loops check the condition,if it true it will run,if false the loop will stop,it will repeat until the condition is false.
  * there are three types of loop:
   1. For: it is used if you know how many times the loop will run.
   2. While: it is used if you dont know how many times the loop will run.
   3. Do While: it similar to While,but the difference it will run at least one even the condition is false.
  * example of loop:
   for(var i=0;i<10;i++)
   {
    //write your code here
   }
   * loop counter: loop use counter as a condition,this instruct the code to run specified number of times.
    the counter is made up of three statments
    1. initalization:create variable and set it to 0; var i=0; .
    2. condition: the loop should run until the counter reaches specified number i<10;
    3. update: every time the loop run the code inside brackts,it add one to the counter.
   * using while loop:
    var i=0;
    while(i<10)
    {
     //write your code here;
     i++
    }
