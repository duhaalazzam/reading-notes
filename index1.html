    <li>It's important to understand who your target audience
    is, why they would come to your site, what information
    they want to find and when they are likely to return.
</li>
<li>
    Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
</li>
<li>
     Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
    will need to go on each page.
</li>
<li> Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
    visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
     You can differentiate between pieces of information
    using size, color, and style.

    Chapter1:
    Structure Summery
</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>
        HTML pages are text documents.
    </li>
    <li>HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
</li>
<li>Tags are often referred to as elements.
</li>
<li>Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
</li>
<li>Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
</li>
<li>Attributes require a name and a value.
</li>
<li>To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>
    Chapter17:
    HTML5 Layout
</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
    <li>The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
    different parts of a web page and help to describe
    its structure.
</li>
<li>
     The new elements provide clearer code (compared
    with using multiple div elements).
    </li>
<li>
    X Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
    elements need to be told which elements are
    block-level elements.
</li>
<li>
    To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
    (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
    which is available free from Google.
</li>
    </ul>
