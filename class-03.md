# Duckett HTML book
## Chapter 3: “Lists”
* There are lots of occasions when we
need to use lists. HTML provides us with
three different types:
 1. Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered.

 3. Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.

## Chapter 13: “Boxes”

* CSS treats each HTML e XX lement as if it has its own box.
* You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.

* Every box has three available properties that
can be adjusted to control its appearance:
1. border
2. margin
3. padding

* You can also control the borders, margin and padding
for each box with CSS.

## Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops”
* A switch statement starts with a
variable called the switch value.
Each case indicates a possible
value for this variable and the
code that should run if the
variable matches that value.

* Due to type coercion, every value in JavaScript
can be treated as if it were true or false; and
this has some interesting side effects.
