## chapter 10:Introducing CSS
* The key to understanding how CSS works is to
imagine that there is an invisible box around
every HTML element.
* CSS allows you to create rules that control the
way that each individual box (and the contents
of that box) is presented.
* CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule
contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.
* CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two
parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.
* block & inline elements
1. Block level elements look like they start on a new line. Examples include the `<h1>-<h6>, <p> and <div>` elements.
2. Inline elements flow within the text and do not start on a new line. Examples include `<b>, <i>,<img>, <em> and <span>`
* Using External CSS: `<link src="style.css">` 
* Using Internal CSS :`<style></style>`
* CSS Selectors
 1. Universal Selector
 2. Type Selector
 3. Class Selector
 4. ID Selector
 
 ##  chapter 11: color
 1. rgb values: These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up.
 2. hex codes: These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign.
 3. color names: There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers.
 * CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value.
