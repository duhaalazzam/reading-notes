## chapter 10:Introducing CSS
* The key to understanding how CSS works is to
imagine that there is an invisible box around
every HTML element.
* CSS allows you to create rules that control the
way that each individual box (and the contents
of that box) is presented.
* CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule
contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.
* CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two
parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.
* Using External CSS : <link href="css/styles.css"/>
* Using Internal CSS :
<style type="text/css">
body {
font-family: arial;
background-color: rgb(185,179,175);}
h1 {
color: rgb(255,255,255);}
</style>

 1. Universal Selector
 2. Type Selector
 3. Class Selector
